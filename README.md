# Hi there, I'm Sai Kalyan! (he/him)

Data Analysis Manager from Boston, with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

I love working at the intersection of machine learning, data engineering, and real-world problem solving, especially when Python, SQL, and R are in the mix.

Whether it's building a sentiment analyzer from tweets, creating resume matching tools, or deploying GenAI pipelines, I enjoy bringing smart ideas to life through code.

Tools of the trade:
- Python | SQL | Power BI | ETL pipelines
- ML & DL | Data Engineering | Data Cleaning | Streamlit, Git, Colab, QuickBase

Let's collaborate!
I'm always up for building something impactful, especially if it involves ML/DL, data engineering, or open-source tools.
