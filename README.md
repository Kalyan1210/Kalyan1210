# Hi there, I'm Sai Kalyan! (he/him)

MSBA grad from Boston, with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insight.

I love working at the intersection of machine learning, data engineering, and real-world problem solving — especially when Python, SQL, and R are in the mix.

Whether it's building a sentiment analyzer from tweets, creating resume matching tools, or deploying GenAI pipelines, I enjoy bringing smart ideas to life through code.

🔧 Tools of the trade:
- Python | SQL | Power BI | ⚙ETL pipelines
- ML & DL | Data Engineering | Data Cleaning | Streamlit, Git, Colab, QuickBase

Let's collaborate!
I'm always up for building something impactful — especially if it involves ML/DL, data engineering, or open-source tools.

Fun Fact: I once modeled a wellbore using MATLAB and still had time to hit 182K WRPS in sales as a business head. Data or dollars, I make both work as no data ois worthy if nt useful to business. 😉
