# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sai Kalyan! (he/him)

🎓 MSBA grad from Boston, with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insight.

🧠 I love working at the intersection of machine learning, data engineering, and real-world problem solving — especially when Python, SQL, and R are in the mix.

🚀 Whether it's building a sentiment analyzer from tweets, creating resume matching tools, or deploying GenAI pipelines, I enjoy bringing smart ideas to life through code.

🔧 Tools of the trade:
- 🐍 Python | 🧮 SQL | 📊 Power BI | ⚙️ ETL pipelines
- 🤖 ML & DL | 🛠️ Data Engineering | 🧼 Data Cleaning | 📦 Streamlit, Git, Colab, QuickBase

📬 Let's collaborate!
I'm always up for building something impactful — especially if it involves ML/DL, data engineering, or open-source tools.

⚡ Fun Fact: I once modeled a wellbore using MATLAB and still had time to hit 182K WRPS in sales as a business head. Data or dollars, I make both work as no data ois worthy if nt useful to business. 😉
